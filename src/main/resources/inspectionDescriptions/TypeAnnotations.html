<p>Inspection to help you paste static type annotation to variables assignments and functions.
    Like 'a = b' or 'def myFun():' And proposes fix for the issue,
    like 'a: int = b' or 'def myFun() -> int:' respectively.
    For now, just int type supported because it is a stub for a future plugin.
